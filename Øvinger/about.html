      <h2>My experience with coding</h2>
    </div>
    <p>I completed my degree in math and science teacher at NTNU in 2013. Later I have teached mainly math and science in junior high in Oslo.
      Last year I decided to complete som IT subjects to teach coding to pupils. I have completed three coding subjects and want to follow this course this year.
      I have completed following subjects:
    </p>‡
      <ul>
        <li>IT6203 - Grunnleggende programmering for lærere</li>
        <li>IT6204 - Anvendt programmering for lærere</li>
        <li>TDT4100 - Objektorientert programmering</li>
      </ul>

          <h2>My expectations to this course</h2>
      </div>
    <p>The other courses I have tried Python and Java, but I also want to learn how to create websites.
    I learned the JavaScript is essential to learn. Therefor I hope to learn how to create a website using HTML, CSS and JS, so that I can pass the knowlegde to other pupils next year.

      <h2>Questions</h2>
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li><b>What does the server in the client server architecture do?</b><br>
        the server is a software in a computer that respons to requests for the clients.
        The web page and database exists on the server´s locale system.
        the server retrieves and transmitts file to the client.
      </li>
      <li><b>What does the client do?</b><br>
        the client sends different requests to a server through a agreed language or protocol, for example HyperText Transfer Protocol(HTTP). The server then respons to the request if the request is validated.
      </li>
      <li><b>What is an IP address?</b><br>
          An internet protocol adress(IP address) is a numerical label to each device connnected to a computer network. An IP adress can be compared to a home adress.
          The IP adress consists of two parts, namely the network ID(street adress) and host ID(house number).
      </li>
      <li><b>What is a DNS?</b><br>
          A domain name andress(DNS) identifies the intitution that owns the computer that contains the server. If you write ntnu.no, then the DNS machine of the organisation that owns the domain ".no" will search for the correct IP adress.
          Then at last your computer shows the homepage of ntnu.
      </li>
      <li><b>What is the difference between the Internet and WWW?</b><br>
          The <i>internet</i> is a global network of networks while the <i>World Wide Web(WWW)</i> is one of many applications that work over the internet. WWW is a collection of documents and other resources which is linked by hyperlinks or Uniform Resource Identifier(URI).
          Web servers are accessed using HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
      </li>
      <li><b>What is HTML?</b><br>
          HTML is a language that defines the structure of your content. This language consists of diffenret tags that can do different things, and often consists of opening and closing tags.
          HTML is often used combined with Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and JavaScript(JS) when developing web pages.
