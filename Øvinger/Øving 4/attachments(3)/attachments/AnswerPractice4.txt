1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?

Users felt the auto play mode was disruptive and it used a lot of mobile data. 

 2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a
device with 320 x 568 resolution?

dev-width stands for the number of pixels of the output device. As I read the 
code a device between 768 px and 1024 px will not display #logo, but a 
device with resolution 320x568 is not in that range. So most likely a 
device with 320x568 wil show #logo. 

I feel that the rest of the code is missing, so maybe there is a decision made for that particular resolution somwhere else in the code. 


3. Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of
dedicated versions like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?

A. Responsive sites can support a variety of devices and screen sizes with a single implementation. 

C. Maintaining a separate mobile site requires additional testing and support. Responsive design's "one size fits all" approach means less headache for developers, business owners, and consumers.

D. Making one responsive website takes less time than making a stand-alone mobile application in addition to a standard desktop website.
