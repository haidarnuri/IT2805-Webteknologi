1. Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in Javascript?

If you write 0.2 + 0.1 in the console you get 0.300000000000004.
Javascript numbers is following the "international IEEE 754" standard, which stores numbers in 64-bits.
Value (Fraction/Mantissa)	           Exponent	                   Sign
52 bits (0 - 51) 	                 11 bits(52 - 62)	            1 bit (63)

With this numbers system there are some numbers which is impossible to create 100 % accurate.

2. What does the method attribute on a form element decide?

The method attribute tells the web browser how to send form data to a server.

POST = Appends form inside HTTP request and is not visible on the address bar.
GET = form values will be visible in address bar. Fine for non-sensitive data.

--------------------

3. Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element is
changed to GET ?

Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
The browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.

4. Why is it considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5 and/or
Javascript?

????????

5. When is it appropriate to use textarea over input ?

Input is a one-line field and textarea is a multi-line field.
