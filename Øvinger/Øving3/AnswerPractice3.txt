1. What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed ?

With the absolute position it is positioned in relation to it's containing element. This does not affect the position
of the surronding element.

With the fixed position the element is positioned in relation to the browser window. This does not affect the
positions of the sorrunding elements. 



2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?

We can use the nth-of-type() selector to select an element that is the nth child of its parent. So by writing:

p:nth-child(3){
  color: blue;
}

you get that the third paragraph has blue text.
