1. What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed ?

With the aboslute position it is positioned in relation to it's containing element, but does not affect the position
of the surronding element. The absolute position moves when the user scrolls up and down the page. 

With thje fixed position the element is positioned in relation to the browswer window. This does not affect the
positions of the sorrunding elements, and they do not move when scrolling up and down the page. 


2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?

We can use the nth-of-type() selector to select an element that is the nth child of its parent. So by writing:

p:nth-child(3){
  color: blue;
}

you get that the third paragraph has blue text.
