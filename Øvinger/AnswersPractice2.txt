1. Why does inline style CSS override rules defined in style elements and external
stylesheets?

In the order of precedence you can see that the last rule will affect the property if you have two rules in the same property. 
Therefor the inline CSS is the last rule before creating the text(paragraph or other things).

Another way of thinking of it is that the "closer" the style is to the element, the higher precedence it has. 


2. Give a brief example of when to use ID ( #id ) and when to use classes ( .class ) in CSS.

The rule for ID are: 1) Every element can only have one ID. 2) Each page can have only one element with that ID. 
The rule for Classes are: 1) You can use the same class on multiple elements. 2) You can use multiple classes on the same element.

An example could be that if you have a page which is bulid like this

<h1>Title number 1</h1>
<p>Something something </p>

<h1>Title number 2</h1>
<p>Something something and even morw something</p>

Then you can sorround the first h1 and p tag with av <div class=""></div> and give it a property without effecting the other h1 and p tag. 

Also you can give the first h1 tag a uniqe ID(<h1 ID ="testing">Title number 1</h1>), which gives you the opportunity to change this tag without
affecting the other tags. 

3. What does RGBA mean and what colors can you express with it?

R -> red
G -> green
B -> blue
A -> alpha

Alpha measures the opacity(gjennomsiktighet). 0 is fully transparent and 1.0 is fully opaque. 
You can construct all the colors with red, green and blue with the RGB color system. 


4. Why do we include CSS files inside the head element and not inside the body element?

By including the CSS file in the head element you can declare the CSS file before the body start, which means
your style is already loaded. This way you increase the performance of your web page. 


5. What CSS selector matches all the p elements inside the article element in the
following HTML?

Following code would change all text inside the article to blue:
article{
	color: blue;
}

Therefor the article selector matches all the p elements inside article.
